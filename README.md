# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
My take on Advent of Code in C# with trying to allocate basically no memory on the heap in the solution methods.<br/>
How many memory was allocated, can be seen in the [Benchmark results](https://github.com/Sterbehilfe/AdventOfCode/tree/master/AdventOfCode.Benchmarks/README.md).<br/>
The only allocations would be the loading of the input into memory, but that happens on startup, so is not counted into the allocated memory of the methods.
